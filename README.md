# Multinational-Retail-Data-Centralisation
You work for a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe.

Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources making it not easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team.

In an effort to become more data-driven, your organisation would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location.

Your first goal will be to produce a system that stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data.

You will then query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.

# Step 1 : Set up New DB to store data.

Initialise a new database locally to store the extracted data.

Set up a new database within pgadmin4 and name it sales_data.

This database will store all the company information once you extract it for the various data sources.

# Step 2: Initialise 3 project classes 
  # Data Extractor Class - To extract data from CSV, API, S3
    Created 3 methods for extractng data
